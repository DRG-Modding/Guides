# BP Modding Video Tutorials:
- Created by myself, featuring a segment recorded by @Samamstar and edited by @Hand Drawn Nerd, this guide aims to walk people through the complex process of BP Modding!
- These videos are not intended to replace my written guide, however I suggest you watch the videos primarily whilst looking at the written guide for any potential finer details.
- The segments recorded include:
   1. Introduction info and setting up your workspace
   2. The basics of setting up native spawning, native spawning with DRGLib & pre-native spawning with BPMM
   3. The no-dummy BP modding method, using the pre-native BPMM method and then converting the same mod to native using BPMM's interface
   4. The dummy BP modding method, which includes how to navigate the C++ header dumps, as well as reflect them and dummy BPs
   5. Reflection demo, which shows exactly how to reflect some certain C++ objects/delegates/functions/properties that weren't covered in episode 4
- There are more segments coming soon! These include:
   - Saving and loading with your mod in DRG
   - Widget animations
   - Replication
   - Creating a custom level
